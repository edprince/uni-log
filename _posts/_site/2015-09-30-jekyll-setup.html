<p>Today I embarked upon the task of a 9:00 am Maths lecture without much
sleep. Fortunately I had covered the first hour and half of the material
the previous night, but it was still heavy goingâ€¦ So, during this part
of the lecture I decided (after a nudge from my bro) to get Jekyll up and
running, since it would be a far better way to document this log. It was a
pain, and took grinding but eventually was done. After a bit of playing
and fiddling, I thought I should probably get back to the lecture. It was
pretty cool, learning about truth tables in propositional calculus, riveting.
Well, it is if you enjoy CS and logic. I am finding the process of taking
perfectly normal sentences in English, and abstracting them to a point that
logical maths can be applied  Pretty cool.
