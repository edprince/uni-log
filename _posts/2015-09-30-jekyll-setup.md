Today I embarked upon the task of a 9:00 am Maths lecture without much
sleep. I know for some people that is not impressive in the slightest, I 
require a good 5-6 hours minimum to function properly at all. Fortunately 
I had covered the first hour and half of the material the previous night, 
but it was still heavy going... So, during this partof the lecture I 
decided (after a nudge from my bro) to get Jekyll up and running, since it 
would be a far better way to document this log. It was a pain, and took grinding
but eventually was done. After a bit of playing
and fiddling, I thought I should probably get back to the lecture. It was
pretty cool, learning about truth tables in propositional calculus, riveting.
Well, it is if you enjoy CS and logic. I am finding the process of taking
perfectly normal sentences in English, and abstracting them to a point that
logical maths can be applied  Pretty cool.

So now I am on the way to Warwick to use the climbing wall, with the
mountaineering society, should be interesting. Fortunately, I appear to not
be the only noob climber here, but I'll wait and see if people are just 
being modest. Also turns out there is some gorgeous land inbetween Coventry
and Warwick (can't help feeling that Warwick get a better deal), but then
they ask for more to get in, so I guess that's logical. I also have this
evening to look forward to, with United playing Wolfsburg in the Champions
Leage. I am deviating slightly from the underlying topic of this blog, but
what the hell. 

I'm looking forward to getting pandoc integrated smoothly into my current
workflow, being able to write consistently and easily with LaTeX might end
up being a bit of a goal for me, definitely helpful for any report writing
that I do. It's odd, I think there is a satisfaction to creating/tweaking a
personal workflow for developing. Although in most ways vastly different, I
think it draws upon similarities to creating a piece of art, or building a
house, or smithing a sword. Sounds weird I know. But that ability to 
customize and build something to your taste is awesome. 

#Climbing#
So, I had an awesome time climbing at the Warwick climbing wall, found it
pretty hard (probably because of my fitness level), but not ridiculous. 
Looking forward to trying out some of the harder routes, and hopefully
improving. The only downside is the price. It's 4 pounds (for some reason
the pound symbol won't work), for the bus, and then 6 to climb. The year
membership would probably be worth getting if I knew I would use it, but
still 170 is a lot... I'll definitely try a few more sessions before making
up my mind. Either way I need to be doing something active, it helps me so
much, I don't know why I often seem to shun it! They are also running a 
laser quest session in October, which I am definitely up for! Then there
is a competition between Coventry and Warwick, which should be fun...
