Our comp architecture tutor was about 30 minutes late, and the lab wasn't in all honesty very useful. Probably only
because I had experience with everything covered. We watched a video on how to build a computer, then looked online
to buy the components, and see how much they cost. I find it difficult to analyse the situation through someone 
else's eyes, but because I built my PC, I had done all of it quite thoroughly before. This was however, followed by
the best lecture so far. It was the logic and sets module (maths), and was covering similar concepts to those
done in my A2 stats module. Had it been someone else delivering, I may well have fallen asleep, but instead it was
really cool. Definitely a module I feel I will enjoy!

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
