So the Computer Science students at Coventry all get given a free
Chromebook laptop. Well, they say free, when you're paying nine grand
it feels more like it's included in the price... But nevertheless, a 
brand new laptop. I had never used, and barely heard about the Chrome OS. I
knew it was based on Linux, but not much else. I spent one evening playing
about with it, and the following day stuck Ubuntu on over the top. This
was **definitely** a good move. It's pretty small (11", compared to my 15"
laptop), and I thought that I would not really get any use out of it. And 
oh how I was wrong. I think the ratio of use of the Chromebook vs my old
laptop has been about 8:1. Here's why.

Size
----
Yes, the screen is small (at first I thought too small) but due to the good
resolution (1366 x 768), it is perfectly easy to see. Not only this, but 
the enormous reduction in size and thickness means that it fits in my 
backpack far more easily that my old laptop, and appears to weigh practically
nothing. It is also, and possibly more importantly, absolutely fantastic
for lectures. It fits comfortably on the small fold out tables we have, 
without getting in people's way.

Ubuntu
------
For me this is a biggie. Ubuntu was a dream to install over the Chrome OS. 
Simply following the instructions on the first Google result will probably
get you there! Now I can switch back between Chrome and Ubuntu with a few 
buttons. I love developing in Ubuntu, so this has been great.

Battery Life
------------
I don't know whether my old laptop has just diminished so much over time, 
but the Chromebook truly does have astonishing battery life. I can leave it 
on in my bag for multiple days, and be taking it in and out. I haven't actually
switched the Chromebook off since getting Ubuntu on. I have had the machine on
all day, and still on 69% battery. I am positive this would change if you
were watching films or something, but for developing, it's great.

Keyboard
--------

It's not perfect. Few are, but it's a million miles better than the majority 
of keyboard I have used that have been restricted to such a small size.
Clearly a lot of thought has been put into the keyboard layout, making the
buttons big enough to be usable, yet small enough to fit. Of course, some
sacrifices have been made. The function keys have been replaced by Chrome 
keys. They are quick ways to change brightness, volume, window etc. There 
is no delete key, only a backspace, but since I develop in vim, I try to stay
away from those anyway. The only other complaint I have is over the up and
down arrow keys. To me, they are squished a bit too much.
