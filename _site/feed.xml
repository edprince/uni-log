    <title>University Log</title>
    <description>I am keeping this as a sort of online log/diary of my events at uni.  Hopefully ranging from lectures to nights out, to my thoughts and opinions on other topics.

        <title>Free Chromebook...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/SmQRIq3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chromebook&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the Computer Science students at Coventry all get given a free
Chromebook laptop. Well, they say free, when you’re paying nine grand
it feels more like it’s included in the price… But nevertheless, a 
brand new laptop. I had never used, and barely heard about the Chrome OS. I
knew it was based on Linux, but not much else. I spent one evening playing
about with it, and the following day stuck Ubuntu on over the top. This
was &lt;strong&gt;definitely&lt;/strong&gt; a good move. It’s pretty small (11”, compared to my 15”
laptop), and I thought that I would not really get any use out of it. And 
oh how I was wrong. I think the ratio of use of the Chromebook vs my old
laptop has been about 8:1. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;size&quot;&gt;Size&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the screen is small (at first I thought too small) but due to the good
resolution (1366 x 768), it is perfectly easy to see. Not only this, but 
the enormous reduction in size and thickness means that it fits in my 
backpack far more easily that my old laptop, and appears to weigh practically
nothing. It is also, and possibly more importantly, absolutely fantastic
for lectures. It fits comfortably on the small fold out tables we have, 
without getting in people’s way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ubuntu&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me this is a biggie. Ubuntu was a dream to install over the Chrome OS. 
Simply following the instructions on the first Google result will probably
get you there! Now I can switch back between Chrome and Ubuntu with a few 
buttons. I love developing in Ubuntu, so this has been great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;battery-life&quot;&gt;Battery Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know whether my old laptop has just diminished so much over time, 
but the Chromebook truly does have astonishing battery life. I can leave it 
on in my bag for multiple days, and be taking it in and out. I haven’t actually
switched the Chromebook off since getting Ubuntu on. I have had the machine on
all day, and still on 69% battery. I am positive this would change if you
were watching films or something, but for developing, it’s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keyboard&quot;&gt;Keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/X6sukRs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chromebook keyboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not perfect. Few are, but it’s a million miles better than the majority 
of keyboard I have used that have been restricted to such a small size.
Clearly a lot of thought has been put into the keyboard layout, making the
buttons big enough to be usable, yet small enough to fit. Of course, some
sacrifices have been made. The function keys have been replaced by Chrome 
keys. They are quick ways to change brightness, volume, window etc. There 
is no delete key, only a backspace, but since I develop in vim, I try to stay
away from those anyway. The only other complaint I have is over the up and
down arrow keys. To me, they are squished a bit too much.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Setting up Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I embarked upon the task of a 9:00 am Maths lecture without much
sleep. I know for some people that is not impressive in the slightest, I 
require a good 5-6 hours minimum to function properly at all. Fortunately 
I had covered the first hour and half of the material the previous night, 
but it was still heavy going… So, during this partof the lecture I 
decided (after a nudge from my bro) to get Jekyll up and running, since it 
would be a far better way to document this log. It was a pain, and took grinding
but eventually was done. After a bit of playing
and fiddling, I thought I should probably get back to the lecture. It was
pretty cool, learning about truth tables in propositional calculus, riveting.
Well, it is if you enjoy CS and logic. I am finding the process of taking
perfectly normal sentences in English, and abstracting them to a point that
logical maths can be applied  Pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I am on the way to Warwick to use the climbing wall, with the
mountaineering society, should be interesting. Fortunately, I appear to not
be the only noob climber here, but I’ll wait and see if people are just 
being modest. Also turns out there is some gorgeous land inbetween Coventry
and Warwick (can’t help feeling that Warwick get a better deal), but then
they ask for more to get in, so I guess that’s logical. I also have this
evening to look forward to, with United playing Wolfsburg in the Champions
Leage. I am deviating slightly from the underlying topic of this blog, but
what the hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to getting pandoc integrated smoothly into my current
workflow, being able to write consistently and easily with LaTeX might end
up being a bit of a goal for me, definitely helpful for any report writing
that I do. It’s odd, I think there is a satisfaction to creating/tweaking a
personal workflow for developing. Although in most ways vastly different, I
think it draws upon similarities to creating a piece of art, or building a
house, or smithing a sword. Sounds weird I know. But that ability to 
customize and build something to your taste is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;climbing&quot;&gt;Climbing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I had an awesome time climbing at the Warwick climbing wall, found it
pretty hard (probably because of my fitness level), but not ridiculous. 
Looking forward to trying out some of the harder routes, and hopefully
improving. The only downside is the price. It’s 4 pounds (for some reason
the pound symbol won’t work), for the bus, and then 6 to climb. The year
membership would probably be worth getting if I knew I would use it, but
still 170 is a lot… I’ll definitely try a few more sessions before making
up my mind. Either way I need to be doing something active, it helps me so
much, I don’t know why I often seem to shun it! They are also running a 
laser quest session in October, which I am definitely up for! Then there
is a competition between Coventry and Warwick, which should be fun…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Maths is fun</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our comp architecture tutor was about 30 minutes late, and the lab wasn’t in all honesty very useful. Probably only
because I had experience with everything covered. We watched a video on how to build a computer, then looked online
to buy the components, and see how much they cost. I find it difficult to analyse the situation through someone 
else’s eyes, but because I built my PC, I had done all of it quite thoroughly before. This was however, followed by
the best lecture so far. It was the logic and sets module (maths), and was covering similar concepts to those
done in my A2 stats module. Had it been someone else delivering, I may well have fallen asleep, but instead it was
really cool. Definitely a module I feel I will enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>First day!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So today was a busy day, with three lab sessions sandwiching a lecture. We started off by looking at Python, and went
into more detail than I was expecting. Although nothing I felt out of my depth with, had I not done any computing
before I would certainly have felt nervous. I think the style of giving a worksheet out and letting students work
through at their own pace suits me. I don’t know whether it is because it feels comfortable, and I don’t like
asking for help, or because I can tackle it in the manner I choose. I thought the lecturer was very clear, very 
friendly and did a great job helping. He did at one point say something along the lines of “[computers are stupid]
you should always tell them as much as you can”. I would challenge this statement. I think there are definitely 
contexts when this is useful, for example machine learning. If your phone had access to the database of your life,
it would do a cracking job at being personal and helpful. I do however think there are many cases when it is useful
to only give the machine the information it needs to be able to complete the task it’s given. Not for any scientific
reason, mind, just because it seems pointless in giving it more that it doesn’t need. Like getting a bag of sand
and emptying it on the beach. The lecture was on computer architecture, and included a brief history of computers.
Watching the Imitation Game could have provided a similar level, but it’s all interesting stuff, so no complaints. 
Then two more labs which were pretty standard (or as standard as they could be for someone on their first proper day 
at university!).&lt;/p&gt;
